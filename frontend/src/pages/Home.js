            the UAE. The procedure for acquiring a business license in UAE will
            include approvals from ministries and departments according to the
            type of business. There are three types of business licenses, viz.
            Mainland, Free Zone and Offshore licenses. Mainland business has
            three more sub-types, Commercial License, Professional License and
            Industrial License. The official formalities towards license have to
